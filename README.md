# Statistics_Mini_Projects

This repository contains learning materials about statistical methods needed in data science. The learning is done in Python and based of scipy package. 
Jupyter notebooks contain the following information:

1. inferential_statistics_1A: 
- sampling and calculating probabilities from a normal distribution
- the correct way to estimate the standard deviation of a population (the population parameter) from a sample
- what a sampling distribution is and how the Central Limit Theorem applies
- how to calculate critical values and confidence intervals

2. inferential_statistics_1B:
- using the central limit theorem to help apply frequentist techniques to answer questions that pertain to very non-normally distributed data from the real world
- performing inference using such data to answer business questions
- forming a hypothesis and framing the null and alternative hypotheses
- testing this using a t-test

3. inferential_statistics_2: 
- bootstrapping
- confidence intervals and p-value calculations
- example of medical charges data

4. inferential_statistics_3:
- Bayesian methods
- using pymc3 model to test medical charge differences
